Shatter.js
==========

Shatter.js provides simple image shattering by dividing a given 
image with a [Voronoi diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).

Get dependencies:
bower install && npm install

This will install d3.js (required for Voronoi generation) and 
smash (to build custom d3.js with Voronoi specific functions only).

Build with 'grunt build'
